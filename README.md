# Python-Programs
Python Programs that demonstrate the use of lists, tuples etc.
1. Split a python list into 2 equal sub lists. For example [1 2 3 4 5 6] converted to [1 2 3] and [4 5 6].
2. Enter an integer value and Iâ€™ll tell you if it exists in the integer list or not : 34
34 has been found at index [5] [12] [13]
The integer list is :
90, 87, 23, 3, 8, 34, 67, 75, 1, 2, 3, 4, 34, 34, 2
3. Write a void function named swap that takes two integers x and y as arguments and swap the values of both in such a way that value of y is assigned to x and value to x is assigned to y(e.g x=8, y=7 the swap function should make x=7 and y=8). The function prints the values of x and y after swapping. In main(), define two integer variable with same names x and y, get their values from the user, print their values ,now call swap function from the main and again print the values of x and y? Are x and y in swap function values are same as in main, if not mention the reason in comments.
4. A palindrome is a number or a text phrase that reads the same backwards as forwards. For example, each of the following five-digit integers is a palindrome: 12321, 55555, 45554 and 11611. Write a function that take in a five-digit integer as input and return 1 if the number is a palindrome otherwise return 0. (Hint: Use the division and modulus operators to separate the number into its individual digits.)
