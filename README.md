# Python-Programs
Python Programs that demonstrate the use of lists, tuples etc.
1. Split a python list into 2 equal sub lists. For example [1 2 3 4 5 6] converted to [1 2 3] and [4 5 6].
2. Enter an integer value and Iâ€™ll tell you if it exists in the integer list or not : 34
34 has been found at index [5] [12] [13]
The integer list is :
90, 87, 23, 3, 8, 34, 67, 75, 1, 2, 3, 4, 34, 34, 2
